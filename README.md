Astralcraft
===========

Harness the power of the stars with Astralcraft! Astralcraft adds shooting stars to your world which can be used to access unique forms of movement and utility.

Shooting Stars
--------------

Largely inspired by [fallen stars in Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Fallen_Star), Astralcraft will cause the night sky to shower your world with shooting stars. These stars can be collected and broken down into star fragments which are useful for crafting star-related items. But beware that any stars not collected during the night will vanish at sunrise!

Warp Stars
----------

A warp star can be crafted with four mese crystal fragments and a shooting star in a 'plus' pattern. Warp stars can be thrown and will teleport the thrower to wherever the warp star lands, similar to [Ender Pearls in Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ender_Pearl). Note that warp stars deplete with use but can be recharged with mese crystal fragments.

Astralite
---------

Astralite is a special node crafted with four star fragments in a square pattern that allows you to make great leaps when standing on it. These giant leaps can be used to traverse chaotic terrain such as sky islands, cliffs, or shattered mountains.

You can also craft with star fragments in common shapes to create astralite stairs, slabs, and walls which all function the same as astralite blocks.

Star Armor
----------

Star fragments can be crafted in the familiar armor patterns to create star armor. This special armor provides slightly less armor than metal armors in most situations, but it gains a large boost to the protection it gives while exposed to moonlight. Star armor also emits light for each piece of armor equipped which makes it great for traveling at night or mining in dark caves ([Wielded Light](https://content.luanti.org/packages/bell07/wielded_light/) required).

However, star armor is also fairly fragile and will break more easily than other armors, so be mindful of how much damage you take whlie wearing it.
